It will use this opportunity to photograph Mercury, make unique measurements of the planet\u2019s environment, and fine-tune science instrument operations before the main mission begins. This sixth and final flyby will reduce the spacecraft\u2019s speed and change its direction, readying it for entering orbit around the tiny planet in late 2026.", "published_at": "2025-01-06T13:00:00Z", "updated_at": "2025-01-07T06:55:39.480154Z", "featured": false, "launches": [{"launch_id": "e81bd43b-6359-4436-911f-01888c3369ef", "provider": "Launch Library 2"}], "events": [{"event_id": 393, "provider": "Launch Library 2"}]}
