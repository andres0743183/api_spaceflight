The Moon is considered to be an excellent exoatmospheric calibration source. However, the current accuracy of the Moon as an absolute reference is limited to 5 \u2013 10%, and this level of accuracy is inadequate to meet [\u2026]", "published_at": "2025-01-09T14:08:15Z", "updated_at": "2025-01-09T14:10:09.933900Z", "featured": false, "launches": [], "events": []}
