Yet after 30 years of study, we don\u2019t know precisely how these objects produce their power. This requires observations at X-ray wavelengths. The state-of-the-art for X-ray images is Chandra (~0.5-1 arcsecond resolution) but this [\u2026]", "published_at": "2025-01-10T19:37:16Z", "updated_at": "2025-01-10T19:40:10.284631Z", "featured": false, "launches": [], "events": []}
