For example, Maxwell revolutionized physics with his unified theory of electricity and magnetism, and the Standard Model of particle physics provides a consistent description of all fundamental forces (electromagnetic, [\u2026]", "published_at": "2025-01-10T19:36:14Z", "updated_at": "2025-01-10T19:40:10.293471Z", "featured": false, "launches": [], "events": []}
