The results paint a fascinating picture that defies how we thought matter falls into such black holes, and points to a potential source of gravitational waves that ESA\u2019s future mission, LISA, could see.", "published_at": "2025-01-13T15:15:00Z", "updated_at": "2025-01-14T07:24:21.074498Z", "featured": false, "launches": [{"launch_id": "3a8c0eb9-dc28-44ed-9b2c-f9340c7f9d37", "provider": "Launch Library 2"}], "events": []}
