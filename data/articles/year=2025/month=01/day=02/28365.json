Retroreflectors are mirrors that reflect the incoming light back in the same incoming direction. Calculating the time required for the beams to bounce back allowed scientists to precisely measure [\u2026]", "published_at": "2025-01-02T20:15:49Z", "updated_at": "2025-01-02T20:20:11.734917Z", "featured": false, "launches": [], "events": []}
